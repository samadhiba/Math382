    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      Our platform was built to encourage learning and foster digital safety. These questions explain the philosophy behind CryptoPhish, from its cryptographic structure to its human-centered design.

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-question">Why does CryptoPhish avoid storing full URLs?</button>
        <div class="accordion-answer">
          <p>
            We prioritize user privacy by never storing the original input. Instead, we use SHA256 hashing to convert each URL into a unique fingerprint. This means we can detect previously flagged content without ever keeping the data itself.

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-question">How does CryptoPhish determine if a URL is unsafe?</button>
        <div class="accordion-answer">
          <p>
            CryptoPhish evaluates submissions using multiple techniques, including hash matching, SSL certificate validation, and pattern recognition. We also consider behavioral clues such as urgency language, impersonated institutions, and user-reported trends.

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-question">What is the purpose of hashing in this system?</button>
        <div class="accordion-answer">
          <p>
            Hashing lets us recognize a match without revealing the original URL. Think of it as comparing shadows instead of the objects themselves. If a shadow matches a previously known threat, we can flag it without needing to know where it came from.

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-question">Is a “clean” result always safe to trust?</button>
        <div class="accordion-answer">
          <p>
            A clean result only means that the URL hash is not in our database. It does not guarantee that the website is safe. You should always assess context, look for spelling errors, suspicious requests, and unexpected redirects before trusting any link.
          </p>

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-question">What role do user submissions play in CryptoPhish?</button>
        <div class="accordion-answer">
          <p>
            Submissions are the heart of our system. Every user-submitted URL helps us identify new threats, train our detection logic, and understand how phishing tactics are evolving. This makes CryptoPhish both reactive and proactive in keeping users safe.

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-question">How is CryptoPhish different from commercial threat databases?</button>
        <div class="accordion-answer">
          <p>
            CryptoPhish is not a corporate product. It is a learning-driven, privacy-respecting tool designed to make detection more transparent. We aim to teach users what makes links suspicious, while still offering meaningful protection powered by community input.
