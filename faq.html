        <button class="accordion-question">üîí Why hash URLs instead of storing them?</button>
        <div class="accordion-answer">
          <p>We use SHA-256 hashing to ensure user privacy. When a URL is submitted, it‚Äôs transformed into a cryptographic hash‚Äîa string of fixed-length characters that reveals nothing about the original input. This lets us match known threats without ever storing or exposing full URLs.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-question">üß† How does SHA-256 help prevent phishing?</button>
        <div class="accordion-answer">
          <p>While SHA-256 doesn't *detect* phishing on its own, it provides a secure method to track known malicious URLs. It acts like a digital fingerprint: if a URL has been previously flagged and hashed, we can match it instantly‚Äîwithout revealing the original input or risking data exposure.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-question">üìä What happens when a URL is flagged?</button>
        <div class="accordion-answer">
          <p>Flagged hashes trigger a warning on screen. Behind the scenes, our system also logs it for future analysis and alerts moderators if needed. We don‚Äôt just store these hashes‚Äîwe learn from them, improving detection patterns through a combination of logic, frequency, and user reports.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-question">üß™ How does CryptoPhish detect threats?</button>
        <div class="accordion-answer">
          <p>We layer SHA-256 hash matching with SSL certificate validation, age-of-domain checks, and pattern recognition. This helps us identify both known and emerging threats. Users can also submit hashes they suspect are dangerous, making the system smarter through community insight.</p>

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-question">‚ö†Ô∏è Is a ‚Äúclean‚Äù result always safe?</button>
        <div class="accordion-answer">
          <p>Not necessarily. A ‚Äúclean‚Äù result only means we haven‚Äôt seen that URL hash before. Users should still look for red flags: urgency cues, bad grammar, suspicious links, and requests for sensitive info. CryptoPhish is a tool‚Äînot a guarantee‚Äîand we encourage layered caution.</p>

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-question">üîç How does this connect to cryptography?</button>
        <div class="accordion-answer">
          <p>CryptoPhish applies cryptographic principles such as one-way hashing, entropy analysis, and SSL verification. We turn textbook ideas‚Äîlike hash collisions and modular expiration checks‚Äîinto real, user-facing tools that empower digital safety without sacrificing clarity.</p>
