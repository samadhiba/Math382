    <h2>Behind CryptoPhish</h2>

      <div class="about-card">
        <h3>Inspiration from the Field</h3>
        <p>
          CryptoPhish was born from firsthand cybersecurity experience. While interning in a Security Operations Center, Ikran Khalif analyzed real phishing threats daily. From spoofed login pages to invoice scams, it became clear that phishing isn’t just technical—it’s emotional and social. Phishing thrives on fear, urgency, and curiosity. This project aims to slow users down, make detection feel accessible, and build trust through transparency.

        <h3>Our Approach to Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          We never store full URLs. Instead, we hash every input with SHA-256, turning even dangerous links into anonymized fingerprints. This lets us protect users without peeking into their activity.

        <h3>Future Projections</h3>
        <p>
          CryptoPhish will soon support full email body analysis. Users will paste suspicious emails into a secure sandbox, where red flags like QR codes, urgency language, and malicious domains are highlighted. In the long term, we envision an educational hub with cryptography visualizers, entropy heat maps, and interactive quizzes.

        <h3>Built for Security, Designed to Teach</h3>
        <p>
          We don't want users to just click “Scan” and leave. Every result on CryptoPhish includes short explanations of SHA-256 hashing, SSL expiration, and other concepts. The math we studied—like modular arithmetic and entropy—comes alive in practical, everyday use.
