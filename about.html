    <h2>Behind CryptoPhish</h2>

    <div class="about-block">
      <h3>Inspiration from the Field</h3>
      <p>
        CryptoPhish was born from firsthand cybersecurity experience. While interning in a Security Operations Center, Ikran Khalif analyzed real phishing threats daily. From spoofed login pages to invoice scams, it became clear that phishing isn’t just technical—it’s emotional and social. <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Emails designed to trick users into giving up sensitive data.">Phishing</span> thrives on fear, urgency, and curiosity. This project aims to slow users down, make detection feel accessible, and build trust through transparency.

      <h3>Our Approach to Privacy</h3>
      <div class="about-columns">
        <div>
          <p>
            We never store full URLs. Instead, we hash every input with <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A one-way cryptographic function used to protect data.">SHA-256</span>, turning even dangerous links into anonymized fingerprints. This lets us protect users without peeking into their activity.
          </p>

          In later versions, CryptoPhish will support full email body analysis. Users will paste suspicious emails into a secure sandbox, where red flags like QR codes, urgency wording, and malformed domains will be highlighted. Embedded links will be hashed and checked instantly. We also plan to add visual cryptography explainers, interactive learning quizzes, and community scoring tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Longer term, we hope to turn CryptoPhish into an educational portal—a bridge between cryptography concepts and everyday digital safety. Think: SSL validation visualizers, entropy heat maps, and real-time hash collision demos.

      <h3>Built for Security, Designed to Teach</h3>
      <p>
        We dont want users to just click “Scan” and leave. Every result on CryptoPhish includes a short explanation: how SHA-256 works, why hashes are safer, and how certificate expiration is calculated. The math we studied—like modular arithmetic and entropy—shows up here in real-world action. We want to make invisible processes visible.
